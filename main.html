                <p class="m-2 ml-3 text-justify"> Hi there! I'm Josh. I'm currently enrolled in the full time coding bootcamp at The Georgia Institute of Technology.
                    After high school, I spent time at Kennesaw State and eventually made my way to The University of Georgia.
                    While I greatly enjoyed my time as a student, I began to discover that I was in school for the entirely
                    wrong reasons. I gave it the old college try but wound up dropping out. I fell into a job doing GIS analysis.
                    What began as a job doing monotonous mapping projects quickly led to implementing SQL server and creating
                    data driven platforms.</p>
                <p class="m-2 ml-3 text-justify">
                    The thought of learning SQL was overwhelming at first. It looked like a bunch of nonsense. However, upon some further digging
                    I discovered that something that looked incredibly complex at first actually became quite simple to me...
                    which leads me to my current adventure.
                </p>
                <p class="m-2 ml-3 text-justify">Business aside, you can find me in Sanford Stadium on any given Saturday that the Dawgs play at home. I have
                    seen every episode of The Office AT LEAST 10 times. There is no amount of hot wings that I will not try
                    to tackle. I have a wonderful girlfriend and family that are the highlight of my life.
